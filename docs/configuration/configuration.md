# Integrating Cloud Costs and Configuration

Cloud cost allocation utilizes on-demand APIs for pricing data, but additional configuration is required for cloud costs and user-specific pricing. Please refer to the specific provider pages for the cloud-specific configurations:

* [AWS](aws)
* [Azure](azure)
* [GCP](gcp)
* [On-Premises](on-prem)

Please note that the cloud costs become available as soon as they appear in the cloud service provider's billing data, with usually several hours to a 24-hour delay. There is currently no reconciliation of the on-demand pricing with the billing data's actual costs.
