In an era where cloud computing has become an integral part of most businesses, keeping track of cloud costs can be a challenge especially with the use of multi-cloud growing. With the ever-expanding complexity of cloud environments, there's a pressing need for a unified solution that provides a clear view of all your cloud expenditures. That's where OpenCost comes in. We are thrilled to announce that OpenCost now supports accessing your provider billing and provides cloud cost visibility beyond Kubernetes across Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform.

## Documentation

To support our new cloud cost functionality, we refreshed our [AWS](https://www.opencost.io/docs/configuration/AWS), [Azure](https://www.opencost.io/docs/configuration/azure-prices), and [GCP](https://www.opencost.io/docs/configuration/gcp-opencost) documentation. The [API](https://www.opencost.io/docs/integrations/api) has been expanded with new endpoints available and more on the way.

## What's Next?

You now have a single tool for monitoring your Kubernetes and cloud consumption and we will continue to expand these features for all OpenCost users. OpenCost not only offers a unified cost monitoring solution but also embraces industry standards. We are proud to announce that we are adopting and implementing the FinOps Foundation's [FOCUS](https://focus.finops.org/) standards, ensuring that our users have access to best practices and compliance guidelines for cloud cost monitoring. We will be releasing additional FOCUS support and continue to expand our cloud cost coverage. Stay tuned!
