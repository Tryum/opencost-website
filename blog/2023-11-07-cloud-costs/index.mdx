## Why Is This Important?

In today's diverse cloud landscape, organizations often find themselves managing multiple cloud providers simultaneously. This can lead to a fragmented view of their expenses, making it challenging to optimize resources and control costs effectively. OpenCost's multi-cloud cost monitoring solution addresses this issue by providing a single, consolidated interface to monitor all your cloud costs. This unified perspective simplifies decision-making, cost allocation, and resource optimization.

Additionally, as cloud environments continue to evolve, there's a growing demand for monitoring various cost types beyond basic cloud infrastructure. OpenCost recognizes this need and is committed to offering customizable interfaces for other cost types, such as Datadog, in the future. We believe that the OpenCost community will play a significant role in shaping and expanding these capabilities.

## Adopting FOCUS Standards

OpenCost not only offers a unified cost monitoring solution but also embraces industry standards. We are proud to announce that we are adopting and implementing the FOCUS standards, ensuring that our users have access to best practices and compliance guidelines for cloud cost monitoring.
