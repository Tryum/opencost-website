Next week November 6-9 is KubeCon North America 2023 and we're excited about all the OpenCost-related events going on.

There will be an [OpenCost Working Session](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america/program/project-engagement/#in-person-project-working-session) on Monday from 9:30 - 10:30am. Everyone is encouraged to attend, whether you're an end-user, contributor, or just wanting to learn more about the project. We are planning on discussing the status of Incubation, the roadmap for the project, and future development on carbon footprint and external asset costs.

OpenCost will be at the [Project Pavilion](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america/program/project-engagement/#in-person-project-working-session) in kiosk F34. We're there the entire duration, so be sure to stop by and say "hi", ask questions, and get stickers and other swag. We're looking for more volunteers to staff the kiosk, why don't you drop by and help answer questions?

Mark Poko and JuanJo Ciarlante from Grafana Labs will be presenting "[Where's Your Money Going? The Beginners Guide to Measuring Kubernetes Costs](https://kccncna2023.sched.com/event/1R2vE/wheres-your-money-going-the-beginners-guide-to-measuring-kubernetes-costs-mark-poko-juanjo-ciarlante-grafana-labs)". They'll dive into Grafana Labs' usage of OpenCost and how they embed it in their Grafana Cloud platform. We're looking forward to the session Thursday November 9 from 2:55pm - 3:30pm.

In addition to the OpenCost working session, kiosk, and the presentation we'll be making a major product feature announcement next week with an initial release.
